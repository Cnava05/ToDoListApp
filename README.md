# ToDoListApp
I.	Project Description

-	The to-do list app is a mobile application made to assist many users in keeping track of all their responsibilities and tasks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This application's user-friendly design makes it easy for users to create, update, and organize tasks, enabling them to remain on top of everything.
-	It is essential to be able to manage your responsibilities and activities appropriately to keep track of your time and productivity. Many young students and workers have busy lives; having an app that helps coordinate activities and keep you on top of your assignments is critical to having an organized and productive day. The application has the goal of addressing the problem that many individuals have with not being able to keep track of their to-do lists and ensuring nothing is forgotten.


II.	Problem Addressing

-	People frequently struggle to keep track of all their activities and responsibilities, especially when they have several duties and deadlines. The old method of writing things down on paper or sticky notes takes time and might get lost or forgotten where it was placed, causing you to miss deadlines and increasing stress.
-	The To-Do List app offers a modern and manageable way to help you stay on top of your responsibilities. The application allows you to create and manage tasks, as well as update and arrange your priorities and mark activities as finished. Furthermore, the app will give you alerts to ensure that you stay on top of all your duties.


III.	Platform

-	The To-Do list application will be created on the Android platform, allowing a huge number of people to access and try it out. Because Android smartphones come in a variety of models and prices, the app will be available to a wide range of consumers with varying demands and budgets. Also, the Android platform is a highly free and controllable platform for publishing the app and modifying it over time.

IV.	Front/Back End Support

-	The most practical solution back end for this project would be Firebase, a platform that offers a variety of features such as a real-time database, authentication, and even hosting. The integration would take place in the future and would greatly aid in the management of the application, such as allowing users to log in based on authentication, cloud services, analytics, and crash reporting, to name a few things that Firebase might provide.
-	The application's front end is in charge of the user interface and interaction with the program. The design will be clean and simple, allowing users to keep all their duties and activities organized. The app will include components such as buttons, input fields, and visual aids to improve the user experience when using the app.


V.	Design

-	To design a clean, simple, and user-friendly application, I am going to help myself with Figma which is a platform that is created to facilitate developers with templates that will help you to design the application's wireframe. When I have the wireframe, I will proceed with the selection of UI elements to add and shape the application.
